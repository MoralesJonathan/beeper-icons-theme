## About The Theme

I noticed when using Beeper that it was lacking a bit in color and personality. The plane line icons made it a little difficult to tell which chat beloged to which app. The inspiration grew from some of Beeper mockups on their website in which they showcase the app using full color icons.

With the ability to add custom themes, I took it upon myself to source out SVGs of every icon and create a simple theme that replaces the boring line icons with full color icons.
